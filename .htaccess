# Rewrite everything else to index.html or server.js? 
# Actually, for a Node app on Hostinger, we usually want to defer to the Node app
# But typically Hostinger uses Passenger or similar. 
# A common pattern is to just have the .htaccess if they use standard Apache proxying.
# If they use 'Setup Node.js App' feature, it creates its own.
# Let's try a standard SPA rewrite first, but since we have an API...

# Rewrite API calls to the local server port if using a reverse proxy setup isn't automatic
# But we can't do port forwarding easily here without mod_proxy enabled and configured by user.
# IMPORTANT: Hostinger "Setup Node.js App" usually handles the port binding.
# We just need to ensure the requests aren't blocked.
